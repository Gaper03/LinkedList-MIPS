# LinkedList-MIPS
This project consists on the implementation of a linked-list using Assembly MIPS. The user has access to a menu where they can select the desired action.
The options are:<br>
- Add a new node: adds a new node to the end of the linked-list;<br>
- Print the list: displays all elements from the linked-list;<br>
- Exit: closes the application.<br>

The project was developed as one of the activities during the Computer Science course at Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo (USP). The course is ministered in portuguese, since 
it is a brazilian university. Therefore, the elements of the code were written in portuguese, as well as the text in the program menu.
